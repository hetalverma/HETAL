			<h2>People like us - You & Me</h2>
			<p>When you are strong but you are tired, you are tired of everything around you. Your faith goes wary, you are happy but hollow from inside. You believe in love, but not in people around you. It takes a lot of strength to feel deeply to the core of your heart. You are happy at times but sometimes you don't feel anything. </p>
			
			<p>You feel this when you are tired of getting hurt over and over again. And here is when you lose yourself. Aren't you changing the way you feel, the way your heart loves?</p>

			<p>The truth is, people like you feel the pain more deeply and know the darkness of the pain. But with all these intense emotions you feel so heavy, you feel good things too and appreciate them more than anyone else. </p>

			<p>So always value being a person like that. Appreciate a heart like you who can feel the pain and still be happy for all the good around you. As much as it hurts sometimes, it's people like you who change others. It's genuine good you bring to the world that fills others with hope and light. </p>

			<p>There is something rare about people like us. You are the hope people look for when everything is lost. You are the love you give freely when they feel empty. You are the holding arms when they feel weak. You are the good world wants. </p>

			<p>So don't ever change. Don't ever let the pain take over you and make you feel depleted. You matter to the world and soon you will realize it, sweet soul.</p>
