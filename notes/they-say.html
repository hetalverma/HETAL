			<h2>they say, life is a party</h2>
			<p>Opening doors to a room full of people chatting and giggling to each other's stories. Welcome to the party, enjoy to your fullest they say. But the question is how long do we stay at this party, what to do what not to do and finally how to leave. Will we make a difference when we leave? Will be remembered by our self once we slip into unconsciousness of our mind?
			Well, I cannot answer these questions for anyone including myself but I can find a way we can make sure our time is not wasted at this party. 
			As we step into this room, we find people, we make memories and as we leave the party we leave memories behind through the lives we touched.
			</p>
			
			<p>But this cool behavior can turn out to be stoic. Indifferences in capturing our own emotions will lead to nowhere. Coolness is all about maintaining control over our mind while never looking as though you might have lost control, but at the end, even a hardshell break and that can be tough to handle.</p>

			<p>The comfort brought by the lives we touch is just like a coin with the other face related to the fact that we have to leave one day. As we walk on sand leaving footprints, our upcoming generation is a part of us making sure we don't leave this party truly. It's of course devastating that we won't be around to see how the lives we touch unfold but it certainly can make a difference.
			And that's why people say the world without us is only different by what we leave behind for we are only guests at this party.</p>
