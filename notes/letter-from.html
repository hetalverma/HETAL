			<h2>letter from a dead girl</h2>
			<p>Dear YOU,<br>
			<p>Until now I used to think suicide is for the weak but this world has compelled me to thank them for all the instances where I lost hope and couldn't jump on to better things. Maybe this made my life easier after all we all look for shortcuts.</p>
			
			<p>I always wanted to ask but aren't there are moments when we fall down and don't want to get up, knowing we can? Hope is just an illusion, a blurred vision of reality. With a hurricane of emotions, dancing sadness, and roaring numbness, I don't feel like going back. Stuck in the same boat and trying hard to get out, it now feels alright, like nothing happened. They shattered my soul, made me manipulate my own thoughts wired with the poison of negativity. </p>

			<p>Don't you dare to call me weak, when I can cut my wrist on my own and you can't even stay alone in a room? Not in anger but in sadness did you ever feel blessed of the life you are living because my life was like a dark sky trying hard to find stars to weave them in a constellation just for a reason to live. But I failed. </p>

			<p>Don't get me wrong, people didn't break me, I was strong, they just took away my positivity, my aura. They made me hollow not a broken piece of art. I faked happiness but now here I am. </p>
			<p>Yours truly<br>
              A dead girl</p>
