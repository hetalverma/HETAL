			<h2>COOL</h2>
			<p>Cool is the calm inside but being cool also refers to the symptoms of confusion, anxiety, self-gratification, and escapism. Having a cool personality doesn't mean that the person is always calm from inside rather it pushes individuals towards passivity. Being Cool has a paradoxical nature in itself. Some might say that cool or calm nature may be idealistic but cool as a whole is not something to idealize about. Coolness is all related to the power of abstract, might be the reason why people say that abstract art is a thing for cool people only*still thinking why some abstract art is way out of my league*</p>
			
			<p>But this cool behavior can turn out to be stoic. Indifferences in capturing our own emotions will lead to nowhere. Coolness is all about maintaining control over our mind while never looking as though you might have lost control, but at the end, even a hardshell break and that can be tough to handle.</p>

			<p>The paradox of the need for self-control in the face of lack of control nurtured a cool attitude in today's generation. And that's the reason why most of the cool people today are alien to their feeling and live in a constant state of alienation.</p>
