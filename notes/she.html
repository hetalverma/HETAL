			<h2>SHE</h2>
			<p>She is the madness he craves for, the one which can make you feel like floating in heaven and stars above. Everything she touches turns to love. She mends the broken and makes it beautiful. She is strong in her own ways, a whirlpool of chaos, and a passionate princess. She loves her life and so does life, loves her back in every little way. Sometimes things make her weak but it's her magic which makes it worth it! She is hers before anyone else and that's what her magic is all about. She is special in her own ways, her pure love manages to keep the warmth in the room. </p>
