			<h2>Rare</h2>
			<p>With depths within you, ocean heart, you feel things more passionately. You dive for people who are afraid to swim for you and you never know how to stop pouring your love for them. </p>
			
			<p>And so there are moments of tender aches, moments wondering about who will love you. Always know you are RARE. With the magic to calm the storms people hold, inspire, and empower people you become a ray of sunshine.</p>

			<p>Your heart and soul needs rest. Let it be sometimes. Remind yourself to be brave for yourself. Pay attention to things that stir your heart and makes you want to smile more often. I hope you find love in places void and dark, in places within yourself that could have been softer and kinder in the past. </p>

			<p>Chase the love and joy stranded in laughter and  hugs of your loved ones❤️
