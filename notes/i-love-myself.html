			<h2>I Love Myself</h2>
			<p>I like myself a little bit more without you<br>
			    I like how I don't have to filter my words<br>
				I like how I don't second guess myself<br>
				because you had a way of making me feel broken,<br>
				incomplete,<br>
				or not enough <br>
				You had a way of comparing me to<br>
				those I don't want to be anything like.</p>
			
			<p>I like myself a little bit more without you<br>
				I don't feel like I'm lying to myself<br>
				I don't feel like I'm hiding myself<br>
				I don't feel like a fool<br>
				I like how I don't have to live up to your expectations,<br>
				I like how I'm free now.<br>
			</p>

			<p>I like myself a little bit more without you<br>
				I like how I don't need your validation<br>
				I like how I don't have to wait for you <br>
				to make up your mind<br>
				I love myself a little bit more<br>
				to the point where I don't need <br>
				YOU.<br>
