			<h2>Happy Soul</h2>
			<p>We are at a stage where we learn to love and learn to live. People make us strong and weak at the same time. Somedays we have no idea what we'll do, how we'll do but in the end it still gets done. And that's what we have to learn from people around us. </p>
			
			<p>Give your heart a break.💝 </p>

			<p>Be excited about every little thing that makes you happy and cherish it the way you used to do when you were a kid.🤗 Yeah! Some people and some memories make you weak on your knees and suddenly all your efforts for happiness go in vain. That's where you need to stand up. So, don't be ashamed of crying. Tears are only water and flowers bloom only by water and sunshine. A ray of hope is always there to make you bloom like a flower.🌼</p>

			<p>Every moment you spend should be a little more than amazing.😎 Surround yourself with people who motivate you to become a better person. Someone who feels good with you. Spread your vibes for which people should crave and which makes them happy. 
			</p>
			
			<p>Forgive people who have caused you pain and hurt. Forgiveness is not for others but for you. It frees you from anger and all the negative vibes and heals your body, mind, and spirit. It gives you a different type of power and makes your soul a good one.💚</p>

			<p>May you begin your journey to
yourself, sweet soul, soon🍃</p>
