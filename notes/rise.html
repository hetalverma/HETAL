			<h2>Rise</h2>
			<p>I make thousands of stories every day in my mind, live in them like ghosts. But don't we want to ever live them? </p>
			
			<p>I want to be a part of every fairytale on this earth, all the real, vivid experiences in this real world. I want to run like a flowing river, smooth and clear, like the wind, fresh and breezy, like all the living organisms on this earth having a life. </p>

			<p>Now since we people say you can't be a part of everything, every story on this is earth, so why don't we write our story so pure and real that it inspires others to live a life - a life that is beautiful and has all the good they ever wanted. People go through tough times in their lives and they come back soon, they rise from the deep dark experience and make a more inspiring impact on others' life - those people are the strongest of all. Nothing lasts forever and so is darkness, lets just rise from the rubble and create something extraordinary.</p>
