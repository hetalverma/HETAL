			<h2>LOVE</h2>
			<p>Love is like lightning. From the very first time we are loved, our body lifts and floats in heaven and stars above. There are sparks, sparks of love and we feel like we can light up the whole world like fire. When in love, we feel beautiful, we feel drunk and everything goes good like a daydream. There is a whole new world for you and there is no going back.</p>
			
			<p>But what happens when your world shudders and falls apart. We feel our world ended and we are on the edge of something that doesn't even exist ever. HOLD ON! Take a deep breath and think isn't this amazing that you are still alive. And yes here comes the reality, it's not the end of the world. </p>

			<p>Sometimes the wrong choices bring us to the right places, and bad things happen to inspire us to change and grow. Things end. People leave. Life goes on. If bad doesn't happen how would you be able to feel the good ones? </p>

			<p>If this feeling is real it will last. People say time heals everything but they miss something. Time heals but changes too. You might be a different person after years and even that person whom you loved, but the thing never changes. </p>

			<p>If the feeling is real then it won't die.<br>
			Love tends to come back!‚ù§</p>
