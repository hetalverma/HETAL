			<h2>we had a thing</h2>
			<p>While I was wandering through the busy streets of the city I saw someone. He was wearing his usual smile and favorite pair of shoes. Nothing much has changed in the streets since the time we knew each other. We looked at each other and waved.</p>
			
			<p>At that moment I sensed a tension between us. Some connection, which was attractive as well as destructive. He looked at me with a charm in his eyes, happy kid. I wanted to go up and say 'Hi'. But suddenly everything came back. Back to the thing we had.  </p>

			<p>It was a pretty busy month of the year and we felt something. Like we are happy together. We used to share everything, from secrets to laughter (except food coz Joey doesn't share food). We used to connect.</p>

			<p>But as we know life isn't that simple and we haven't done our masters yet, we both lowered our eyes and passed each other with the same compatibility we used to have. It was a beautiful day.</p>
