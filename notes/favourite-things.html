			<h2>Favourite Things</h2>
			<p>So it feels like I had a vase. I filled it with all the love, memories (good &bad), all those years I acted mature but wasn't and then the vase fell and broke into thousand little pieces and I was standing over there looking at the mess., just to ignore the fact that my heart was broken. </p>
			
			<p>I chose a mug which felt like another vase but wasn't one. I think mug already had a crack and it broke and this time I was bleeding. That's when I realized that I wanted a vase and settled for a mug and now I have to confront my broken heart. </p>

			<p>The vase never made me bleed red but the mug did and I think that's what I want. Here I'm trying to pick up the leftover pieces of that vase. And even if I bring all the pieces together they'll never be the same so I keep those pieces with me as souvenir inside a drawer. I won't lock it because no one would steal them now.</p>

			<p>It feels good when you don't have hate for what has happened rather cherish it. But I should warn you to put a band-aid over the cut to stop the bleed or else it will take too long to heal.</p>
			<p>Not all favourite things last for long, but they'll always have a great impact on your next favourite thing. Choose wisely!</p>
